# Summary

You are a data scientist for Migros, tasked with finding the best places to create new stores. Analyze market opportunities based on the density of existing stores, presence of competitors, and general population density to inform Migrosâ€™ development strategy.

# Technologies

- Google Map API / Open Street Map API
- Python with Pandas, Plotly, Streamlit, Pathlib etc.

# Working Strategy

- Collecting data: this step costs a lot of time (~50%) and effort. How good the result is depends on the input data, so this step should be done very carefully. Sometimes we even need to cross check (eg. two people working on this and cross-check the collected data or we can collect data from different sources and compare them).
- Analysing the data, create criterias / indicators which can help to make decisions.
- Implement the logic by processing the data first, then use it to plot diagrams or charts which will visually help people to easily make decisions.
